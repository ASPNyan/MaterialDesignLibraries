This library only has one component, and it's the `MdMudThemeProvider` which is to be used instead of the standard
`MudThemeProvider` to allow the use of Material Design themes in MudBlazor components. It should just be put in your
default layout somewhere, just ***not*** in the head or `DynamicHeadContent`.# README.md
