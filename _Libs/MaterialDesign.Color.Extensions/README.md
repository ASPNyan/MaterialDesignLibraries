`MaterialDesign.Color.Extensions` is a much smaller library than it's parent library at `Nyan.MaterialDesign.Color`, 
just providing some minimal extensions to its parent library `MaterialDesign.Color`. With some small additions, 
like Color Deficiency color filters, some `CorePalette`extensions, other colorspace extensions, 
it's useful when you need it, and isn't too heavy.
